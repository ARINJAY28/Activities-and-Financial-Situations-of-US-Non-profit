For the project, our team would like to look into this dataset about Charities and Non-profit organizations in the United States’ Mid-Atlantic and Great Lakes Areas. More specifically, the dataset presents organizations’ basic information, financial situations, and classifications. 

You can download the dataset in the CSV format at https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/eo_info.pdf. The dataset’s size is 113.8 MB and is last updated on 11/11/2019. The dataset has 644942 records at the transactional level and 28 variables. Each record represents a tax-exempt organization. 

From this dataset, we cleaned and wrangled the data into a star schema relational database using SQL and Linux shell commands. Then, we analyzed the data to answer the following questions:

1. Which tax-exempt organizations to which contributions are not deductible have the highest revenue in the 2018 tax period? 
2. Which activity has the highest and lowest number of organizations? 
3. Out of the most popular activities, what’s the average income for the exempt organizations in each state? 
4. Consider the last 5 tax periods. Which months have the highest number of organizations that first received the exempt status?
